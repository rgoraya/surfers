      %p
        %b Arena Soccer Park of Orange, 2190 North Canal Street, Orange, CA 92865.
      %p
        The field is a regulation sized indoor soccer
        field with full sized goals. The turf field is
        walled so the ball is in play all the time (no
        side-line or corner hits). The venue allows a
        unique fast/indoor hockey experience in an
        outdoor setting.
