%h3 History of Surfers
%p
  Huntington Beach Field Hockey Club was
  %b founded in 1987 by Olympian Kuldip Bhogal.
  Kuldip was not only a founder of the club, but also an inspiration to his friends that later joined the club. What gave this club its edge over the other local clubs was the involvement of the member’s families. It was not a ‘boys only’ club. As the members matured, their children took up the sport and it was not long before the club had its own children’s teams participating and winning the leagues and competitions. In fact, over the last few years, the United States National team has always had a HBFHC member as part of its squad.

  The origins of field hockey have been traced to ancient Egypt and Persia and even to the Aztec Indians. Certainly, stick-and-ball games that resemble field hockey have been played by many peoples all over the world, but there's no way to draw up a family tree incorporating all, or even most, of them.
